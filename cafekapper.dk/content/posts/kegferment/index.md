Those shiny glycol-cooled jacketed conical unitanks made from stainless steel are something many home brewers regard as the ultimate gear for only serious home brewers. So many nice tri-clamp attachments for dumping yeast, dry hopping, sampling, etc. But I hate to break it to you: it won't improve the quality of your beer, neither will it make your life easier. And, it's a waste of thousands of dollars if you've read this post.

If you are fine using a temperature controlled fridge or keezer for fermentation, cornelius kegs are absolutely fantastic and inexpensive unitanks. They are very flexible in terms of batch sizes, you can just use more than one, and they are particularly useful for split batch experiments with the same wort, where you can learn a ton by using different yeast strains, hops, or temperature and pressure settings, and so on. They can withstand a MUCH higher pressure than most unitanks too, up to 9 bars (135 PSI) compared to usually barely 1.5 bars (25 PSI). But what about oxygen free dry hopping under pressure and dumping the yeast cake from the bottom to store in your yeast bank? They don't have those nice and flexible tri-clamp posts for a multitude of attachments like conical unitanks do! Or do they?

I found this keg lid on AliExpress that made me get rid of my shiny SS brewtech conical fermenter and "upgrade" to cornelius kegs.

cleaning easier, same format, bucket blaster
only downside is volume
floating dip tube
hop dropper
flip it to dump yeast

but they don't have that flexible tri-clamp post for dry hopping. Or do they?
