<p>Water is the most important ingredient in beer and most people get it wrong
 - because they overthink it. This is my simple, and detailed, guide to 
understanding important aspects of brewing water. It's
really not as complicated as most people think. A proper water profile can take 
your beer to the next level and make good beers great!
Too-long-didn't-read's at the start of each section. Read or skip the details, your choice.</p>

<p>There are essentially only two aspects of water chemistry that are important 
to talk about when it comes to beer: <b>Residual alkalinity</b> and the
<b>mineral composition</b>.</p>

<h2>Alkalinity and residual alkalinity</h2>

<h3>TLDR</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A high residual alkalinity means a high buffering capacity and resistance to changes in pH</li>
  <li>Bicarbonate is the primary compound in brewing water acting as a pH buffer, increasing alkalinity</li>
  <li>Bicarbonate itself doesn't taste of anything</li>
  <li>Cations like Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> neutralize and lower the buffering capacity of bicarbonate, decreasing alkalinity</li>
  <li>Residual alkalinity takes into account the reduction in buffering capacity as a result of the presence of cations like Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup></li>
  <li>Alkalinity is irrelevant, only the residual alkalinity matters in practice</li>
  <li>Pre-boiling your brewing water does not reduce the residual alkalinity much, only the concentration of cations</li>
</ul>

<p>This is perhaps the most important, because it directly impacts the pH 
of the water and thus both the taste of the end result as well as the mash efficiency. 
Alkalinity is a term describing the <b>buffering capacity</b> of the water, or 
in other words its <b>ability to neutralize acids (and bases)</b> and a high 
alkalinity will reduce the
impact of acids and the resulting change in pH. The main compound impacting the 
alkalinity in drinking water most places is bicarbonate (HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>).
Most sources of water has some level
of bicarbonate because CO<sub>2</sub> readily dissolves in water from the
atmosphere and other sources such as limestone in groundwater deposits, and will be
dissolved in the form of bicarbonate. In fact, the same thing happens when beer is
carbonated with CO<sub>2</sub>, it's just a hell of a lot more bicarbonate 
(probably 2000-3000 ppm or more). Already
now we don't have to talk about how it impacts taste by itself because you know how sparkling
water tastes. Bicarbonate itself doesn't taste of anything, so you shouldn't try to copy
the exact bicarbonate levels from recipes from other brewers. It's simply a matter
 of dialing in the pH, as you'll learn about below.
</p>
<p>
If the water contains a high concentration of bicarbonate
it has a high alkalinity. As bicarbonate also helps with stabilizing the pH during the mash
it's good to have some level of it, say 50-100 ppm (mg/L), or else the pH can drop 
too low. Too much of it on the other hand will negatively affect the
mash efficiency because of the increased pH outside the optimal 
range (5.2 - 5.5) of the amylase enzymes naturally present in the malt, which the brewer takes
advantage of for the saccharification of starch present in the endosperm.
</p>

<p>So, what's <b>residual alkalinity</b> then? Well, now we also need to talk a bit
 about "hard" water. Generally a high bicarbonate content also means a high affinity
for cations, especially Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>, and so the water is also likely
to have a higher concentration of cations. Water with a high concentration of cations is
what we would normally call "hard" water, and the two generally go hand in hand, 
especially in groundwater sources. By binding (electrostatically) with bicarbonate
cations neutralize the buffering capacity of bicarbonate thus lowering the
overall alkalinity of the water. The term taking this effect into account is 
called the <b>residual alkalinity</b> and is only what's relevant to the brewer in practice.
This effect is also the reason why some people with very hard water choose to boil
their brewing water before brewing with it, because bicarbonate precipitates 
with both Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> forming limescale (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) 
and magnesium carbonate MgCO<sub>3</sub>, reducing the overall content of both.
This hardly reduces the residual alkalinity, because, as mentioned, Ca<sup>2+</sup> 
and Mg<sup>2+</sup> both reduces the alkalinity, but they are also removed by the boil. So
if you choose to boil your brewing water, it should only be for the purpose of lowering the 
concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions (to be able to 
add salts without raising the cation levels into the extreme), and this
 results in reduced hardness of the water, not so much the alkalinity,
because only the <b>residual alkalinity</b> counts in practice!
</p>

<h2>Mash pH</h2>

<h3>TLDR</h3>
<ul>
<li>A proper mash is all about manipulating enzymes and their activity by ensuring a proper temperature and pH, TOGETHER!</li>
<li>A high residual alkalinity requires the addition of acid or using acidulated malts</li>
<li>Predicting the exact mash pH is difficult regardless of knowing the residual alkalinity and recipe</li>
<li><b>ALWAYS measure the pH during the mash and adjust accordingly</b>. Cheap pH meters or pH strips work just fine!</li>
<li>A low mash temperature (62-64C) requires a lower pH around 5.2 to optimize beta amylase activity</li>
<li>A high mash temperature (70-72C) requires a higher pH around 5.5 to optimize alpha amylase activity. Alpha amylase also <b>requires</b> Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The reason why residual alkalinity is so important on the brew day is because pH 
is important! Everything the mash is all about is the saccharification
of starch into simpler and smaller sugars by the different enzymes naturally present in the malt.
The brewer's only, and very simple, job during the mash is
 really just to manipulate the activity of enzymes, mainly alpha 
and beta amylase, by <b>ensuring a proper pH and temperature</b> (and also proper recirculation)
that is optimal for these enzymes to do their work effectively.
That's it, it's not rocket science, it's elementary school stuff! To ensure a 
proper mash efficiency <b>the pH must always be between 5.2-5.5 regardless of beer style!</b>
 If the pH is not within this range the mash efficiency will drop significantly and the beer will
 taste sour if the pH is too low, and too harsh if it's too high.
The malt and the saccharification process by itself will also lower the pH, but usually not enough.
Exactly how much depends on the residual alkalinity and also the grain bill and recipe.
If the brewing water has a high residual 
alkalinity, you most likely need to adjust the pH by either adding acid
(usually lactic acid or phosphoric acid) or include 
acidulated malts in the grain bill to get the pH down into the optimal range.
The grains themselves also contain many different compounds
with a significant buffering capacity, but it's really difficult if not
impossible to calculate and predict the exact mash pH depending on the recipe. 
With pure water the pH can be calculated rather precisely using for example the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henderson%E2%80%93Hasselbalch_equation">Henderson-Hasselbach equation</a>,
 but it's only useful with pure water.
Therefore, <b>always measure the pH using a pH meter or a pH strip 
10-15 minutes into the mash and then adjust accordingly</b>. I use a $20 pH meter
and it's roughly on par with a professional lab-grade one we have at work. 0.1 precision
is absolutely fine.
</p>
<p>
The exact target pH depends on the mashing schedule. A highly fermentable mash
profile such as that used for lagers and other light bodied beers, will aim 
to optimize the activity of <b>beta amylase</b> to primarily yield maltose and maltotriose. 
The optimal conditions for beta amylase activity is a temperature around <b>62-64C 
and pH around 5.2</b>. For a big-body beer the mash profile should optimize
alpha amylase activity to yield more dextrines and unfermentable sugars in the
final beer. The optimal conditions for <b>alpha amylase</b> is a
temperature around <b>70-72C and pH around 5.5</b>. Additionally, alpha amylase
 is a metallo-enzyme and <b>requires Ca<sup>2+</sup></b> to function. Most beers 
are just fine with a medium-body profile that optimizes the activity 
of both enzymes, and for that I would aim for a pH of 5.3-5.4.
There are of course other enzymes that are relevant, like beta-glucanase, 
phosphatases, proteinase, peptidases, but the high-quality malts available today
 are well modified and generally don't need other temperature "rests" to 
 enhance mash efficiency.

<h2>Mineral composition</h2>

<h3>TLDR</h3>
<ul>
<li>5 different ions are the most important for brewing water. 
  Those are: Calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>),
  Magnesium (Mg<sup>2+</sup>),
  Sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>),
  Chloride (Cl<sup>-</sup>),
  and Sulphate (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>).</li>
<li>Calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) doesn't contribute with any desirable taste on its own, but has positive
   side-effects including increasing stability and clarity of the final beer, 
   precipitates phosphates and is required by alpha-amylase. Always ensure a minimum
   Calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) level of 30-40 ppm.</li>
<li>Almost always keep Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> levels low (0-30 ppm).
 The only exception is when you want a salty taste, then raise the Na<sup>+</sup> level</li>
<li>When it comes to taste only Chloride (Cl<sup>-</sup>) and Sulphate (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>), and the ratio between 
  them, is the most relevant</li>
<li>Chloride (Cl<sup>-</sup>) accentuates "fullness". Typical range is 0-250ppm.</li>
<li>Sulphate (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>) accentuates "dryness" and makes
 bitterness more crisp. Typical range is the same as with Chloride (Cl<sup>-</sup>), 0-250ppm</li>
<li>Never push both Chloride (Cl<sup>-</sup>) and Sulphate (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>)
  levels to more than 80-100 ppm at the same time. This can cause harsh and unpleasant flavors.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Traditionally the local water source from a particular region was used as-is without any adjustments and the
  character of some beer styles originates partly also from the mineral content of the
   water from the particular region where the brewery invented the style centuries ago. Today,
 most breweries are in complete control of the mineral content of the water where
 they will both gather reports regularly about the source water and adjust accordingly
  using salts. When it comes to the taste of the water itself and how it suits a particular beer style
the mineral composition is important. Minerals are dissolved in water
as ions, which either have a positive (cations) or negative (anions) charge. 
Luckily we essentially only have to know about 5 different ions that are relevant to brewing water for beer, they 
are: <b>Calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>)</b>, <b>Magnesium (Mg<sup>2+</sup>)</b>, <b>Sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>)</b>,
 <b>Chloride (Cl<sup>-</sup>)</b>, and <b>Sulphate (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>)</b>. The ratio of the
 latter two is very important, which we will come back to in a bit.
 Some would also include <b>Potassium (K<sup>+</sup>)</b>, but it's only really needed 
  in a very low amount for the yeast (typical range: 0.5-2.0 ppm),
  otherwise the taste is similar to <b>Sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>)</b>
  giving a salty taste. Both should generally just be kept low regardless of style.
 One beer style in particular that needs a lot of Sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>) though is the Gose.
 It needs to be salty, but most other styles hardly needs Sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>).
 Typical range is 2-25 ppm. <b>Magnesium (Mg<sup>2+</sup>)</b> has a minerally and even bitter taste in excess.
 Generally keep it low (0-30 ppm) since it contributes with no flavor that is 
 relevant or supportive to beer.
</p>
<p>
<b>Calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>)</b>, as mentioned, mostly impacts the alkalinity
 of the water together with Magnesium (Mg<sup>2+</sup>). The taste of Calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>)
 is not very distinct on its own, in high amounts (120ppm or more) it will taste a bit
 like chalk, and, well, hard water. The real benefits of Calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) is its 
 side-affects on other things. There are many benefits of Calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>),
 which include improving stability and clarification of the final beer, it helps precipitate 
 phosphates, and most importantly required for optimal alpha amylase activity
 during saccharification at higher mash temperatures. Therefore, it's important that
 a minimum of 30-40 ppm or so is always present regardless of beer style, even with
 a low mash temperature. Typical range is 30-100 ppm, while most ales and 
 generally anything but lagers should benefit from 60-70ppm.
</p>

<h3>Sulphate to Chloride ratio</h3>
<p>
<b>Chloride (Cl<sup>-</sup>)</b> and <b>Sulphate (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>)</b> levels and the
ratio between them are the most important ions when it comes to taste. They directly
 influence the taste and mouthfeel of the beer and the amounts of each must be chosen carefully to match
 the style. In the end it's purely a subjective matter and up to the brewmaster
 to decide what he wants to accentuate in the beer. But simply put, high Chloride (Cl<sup>-</sup>)
 levels accentuate "fullness", as well as body and sweetness/maltiness, 
 while high Sulphate (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>) levels will make the beer
 dry and crisp, and supports bitterness well. The minimum threshold for both
 to affect the taste at all is around 50-60 ppm. Typical ranges for both is 0-250ppm.
 The overall level of both anions and the ratio between them is generally adjusted to
 match the beer style. A typical balanced Sulphate/Chloride ratio is between
 0.8-1.5, whereas a ratio that suits more malty or "full" beers would be 0.5-0.7.
 For beers like west coast IPA's with a high level of bitterness it can be
 appropriate to raise both the level of Sulphate (150-250 ppm) and also 
 increase the Sulphate/Chloride ratio to as high as 4-9 by lowering the Chloride level
 accordingly. Regardless of the ratio, it's very important that both the Sulphate and Chloride levels are
 never elevated at the same time (max 100ppm for both), because this can lead to harsh 
 and unpleasant flavors. According to the book "Water: A Comprehensive Guide for Brewers"
 by John Palmer and Colin Kaminski here are some general guidelines:
</p>

<ul>
<li>0-0.4: Too Malty</li>
<li>0.4-0.6: Very Malty</li>
<li>0.6-0.8: Malty</li>
<li>0.8-1.5: Balanced</li>
<li>1.5-2.0: Slightly Bitter</li>
<li>2-4: Bitter</li>
<li>4-9: Very bitter</li>
<li>9+: Too bitter!</li>
</ul>
<p>
Personally, I like to think a bit differently and associate Chloride with "fullness"
 and Sulphate with "dryness" and not "malty" or "bitter", respectively. For example, in recent 
 years the ever so popular heavily dry-hopped juicy and hazy New England IPA with 
 a very low bitterness a very low Sulphate/Chloride ratio is in its right.
 By raising Chloride levels as high as 200-250 ppm,
 while keeping Sulphate levels below detection threshold (50-60 ppm) it really makes
 the tropical juice shine. A good level of sweetness is important to support all the hops, so the 
 "fullness" from the high levels of Chloride can really make it pop. I know the 
 guys at Verdant are keen on high levels of Chloride for many of their 
 world class juicy DIPA's and I personally do the same.

<h3>How to adjust your brewing water using salts</h3>
<p>
It's very important to know the mineral composition of your source water before
 trying to adjust it. Gathering information about your particular source water can
 sometimes be tricky as it's not always readily available from all suppliers across the world. Contact
 them or check their website. I'm lucky that in my area I can just enter my address online and 
 get a quality report including mineral content from the particular ground water 
 station, but if that's not available to you, you are going to have to spend some money 
 either getting a water sample analysed at a laboratory or buy a water examination kit yourself. 
 In most cases, it's cheaper to just use bottled mineral water (mineral content is often written on the packaging)
 or in the long term even cheaper to just buy a small reverse osmosis system to produce
 almost completely demineralized water at home and then add salts to get to where you want.
 I've got my RO system for around 100$, so it quickly pays for itself after only a 
 handful of brews compared to bottled water. Since I know the mineral content of my source water,
 I usually dilute with 40-70% RO water depending on the beer style and matching water profile.
 It's necessary since my water is very hard, so I have to get Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels
 down to be able to increase both SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> levels with salts.
 You can also use 100% RO water if you don't know anything about your source water,
 but then you must add stuff like baking soda or limescale to increase bicarbonate levels.
 One noticable advantage of using 100% RO water is that you might be able to hit
 the optimal pH range (5.2-5.5) by dialing in the bicarbonate level instead of having
 to buy both a pH meter and acids.


  Normally those salts are CaCl<sub>2</sub>, MgCl<sub>2</sub>,
 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, CaSO<sub>4</sub>, and regular table salt NaCl.
</p>
<li>It's not possible to raise the concentration of a single ion alone without also 
  increasing the concentration of another, because they can only be added as salts (a pair of cation+anion)</li>

Bicarbonate 2000 ppm+ when beer is carbonated

notes:
high sparge water pH is bad
pH makes the beer taste crisp and fresh

As a matter of fact, the only reason to carbonate beer in the first place 
is to release aromatic volatile compounds from the beer so that it can reach your 
nose from the back of your mouth (yes, half of the taste experience!).
Fun facts aside, back to alkalinity.
