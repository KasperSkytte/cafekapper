<p>Water is the most important ingredient in beer and most people get it wrong
 - because they overthink it. This is my simple guide to it, because it's
really not as complicated as most people think. A proper water profile can take 
your beer to the next level and make good beers great!
TLDR's at the bottom of each section. Read or skip the details, your choice.</p>

<p>There are essentially only two aspects of water chemistry that are important 
to talk about when it comes to beer: <b>Residual alkalinity</b> and the
<b>mineral composition</b>.</p>

<h2>Alkalinity and residual alkalinity</h2>

<h3>TLDR</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A high residual alkalinity means a high buffering capacity and resistance to changes in pH</li>
  <li>Bicarbonate is the primary compound in brewing water acting as a pH buffer, increasing alkalinity</li>
  <li>Cations like Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> neutralize and lowers the buffering capacity of bicarbonate, decreasing alkalinity</li>
  <li>Residual alkalinity takes into account the reduction in buffering capacity as a result of the presence of Cations like Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup></li>
  <li>Alkalinity is irrelevant, only the residual alkalinity matters in practice</li>
  <li>Pre-boiling your brewing water does not reduce the residual alkalinity, only the cation concentrations</li>
</ul>

<p>This is perhaps the most important, because it directly impacts the pH 
of the water and thus both the taste of the end result and the mash efficiency. 
Alkalinity is a term describing the <b>buffering capacity</b> of the water, or 
in other words its <b>ability to neutralize acids (and bases)</b> and reduces the
impact of acids and the resulting change in pH. The main compound impacting the 
alkalinity in drinking water most places is bicarbonate (HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>).
Most sources of water has some level
of bicarbonate because CO<sub>2</sub> readily dissolves in water from the
atmosphere and other sources such as limestone in groundwater deposits, and will be
dissolved in the form of bicarbonate. In fact, the same thing applies when beer is
carbonated with CO<sub>2</sub>, it's just a hell of a lot more bicarbonate. Already
now we don't have to talk about how it impacts taste by itself because you know how sparkling
water tastes. The reason to carbonate beer in the first place though, 
is to release aromatic volatile compounds from the beer so that it can reach your 
nose from the inside (yes, half of the taste experience!). Fun facts aside, back to alkalinity.
If the water contains a high concentration of bicarbonate
it has a high alkalinity. As bicarbonate also helps with stabilizing the pH during the mash
it's good to have some level of it, say 50-100 ppm (mg/L), or else the pH can drop 
too low. Too much of it on the other hand will negatively affect the
mash efficiency because of the increased pH outside the optimal 
range of the amylase enzymes naturally present in the malt, which the brewer takes
advantage of for the saccharification of starch present in the endosperm.
</p>

<p>So, what's <b>residual alkalinity</b> then? Well, now we also need to talk a bit
 about "hard" water. Generally a high bicarbonate content also means a high affinity
for cations, especially Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>, and so the water is also likely
to have a higher concentration of cations. Water with a high concentration of cations is
what we would normally call "hard" water, and the two generally go hand in hand, 
especially in groundwater sources. By binding (electrostatically) with bicarbonate
cations neutralize the buffering capacity of bicarbonate thus lowering the
overall alkalinity of the water. The term taking this effect into account is 
called the <b>residual alkalinity</b> and is only what's relevant to the brewer in practice.
This effect is also the reason why some people with very hard water choose to boil
their brewing water before brewing with it, because bicarbonate precipitates 
with both Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> forming limescale (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) 
and magnesium carbonate MgCO<sub>3</sub>, reducing the overall content of both.
This hardly reduces the residual alkalinity, because, as mentioned, Ca<sup>2+</sup> 
and Mg<sup>2+</sup> both reduces the alkalinity, but they are also removed by the boil. So
if you choose to boil your brewing water, it should only be for the purpose of lowering the 
concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions, which means reducing the hardness of the water, not to reduce the alkalinity,
because only the residual alkalinity counts in practice!
</p>

<h2>Mash pH</h2>

<h3>TLDR</h3>
<ul>
<li>A proper mash is all about manipulating enzymes and their activity by ensuring a proper temperature and pH, together!</li>
<li>A high residual alkalinity requires the addition of acid or using acidulated malts</li>
<li>Predicting the exact mash pH is difficult regardless of knowing the residual alkalinity and recipe</li>
<li><b>ALWAYS measure the pH during the mash and adjust accordingly</b>. Cheap pH meters or pH strips work just fine!</li>
<li>A low mash temperature (62-64C) requires a lower pH around 5.2 to optimize beta amylase activity</li>
<li>A high mash temperature (70-72C) requires a higher pH around 5.5 to optimize alpha amylase activity. Alpha amylase also requires Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The reason why residual alkalinity is so important on the brew day is because pH 
is important! Everything the mash is all about is the saccharification
of starch into simpler and smaller sugars by the different enzymes naturally present in the malt.
The brewer's only, and very simple, job during the mash is
 really just to manipulate the activity of enzymes, mainly alpha 
and beta amylase, by <b>ensuring a proper pH and temperature</b> (and also proper recirculation)
that is optimal for these enzymes to do their work effectively.
That's it, it's not rocket science, it's elementary school stuff! To ensure a 
proper mash efficiency <b>the pH must always be between 5.2-5.5 regardless of beer style!</b>
All the sugar present in the malt will itself lower the pH, but usually not enough.
But that depends on the residual alkalinity and also the grain bill and recipe.
If the brewing water has a high residual 
alkalinity, you most likely need to adjust the pH by either adding acid
(lactic acid is probably the most common because of its neutral taste) or include 
acidulated malts in the grain bill to get the pH down into the optimal range.
The grains themselves also contain many different compounds
with a significant buffering capacity, but it's really difficult if not
impossible to calculate and predict the exact mash pH depending on recipe. 
With pure water the pH can be calculated rather precisely using for example the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henderson%E2%80%93Hasselbalch_equation">Henderson-Hasselbach equation</a>.
Therefore, <b>always measure the pH using a pH meter or a pH strip 
10-15 minutes into the mash and then adjust accordingly</b>. I use a $20 pH meter
and it's on par with a professional lab-grade one we have at work.
</p>
<p>
The exact target pH depends on the mashing schedule. A highly fermentable mash
profile such as that used for lagers and other light bodied beers, will aim 
to optimize the activity of <b>beta amylase</b> to primarily yield maltose and maltotriose. 
The optimal conditions for beta amylase activity is a temperature around <b>62-64C 
and pH around 5.2</b>. For a big-body beer the mash profile should optimize
alpha amylase activity to yield more dextrines and unfermentable sugars in the
final beer. The optimal conditions for <b>alpha amylase</b> is a
temperature around <b>70-72C and pH around 5.5</b>. Additionally, alpha amylase
 is a metallo-enzyme and <b>requires Ca<sup>2+</sup></b> to function. Most beers 
are just fine with a medium-body profile that optimizes the activity 
of both enzymes, and for that I would aim for a pH of 5.3-5.4.
There are of course other enzymes that are relevant, like beta-glucanase, 
phosphatases, proteinase, peptidases, but the high-quality malts available today
 are well modified and generally don't need other temperature "rests" to 
 enhance mash efficiency.

<h2>Mineral composition</h2>
<p>
When it comes to the taste of the water itself and how it suits a particular beer style
the mineral composition is important. Minerals are dissolved in water
as ions, which have a positive (cations) or negative (anions) charge. 
There are 5 different ions that are relevant to brewing water for beer, they 
are: <b>Calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>)</b>, <b>Magnesium (Mg<sup>2+</sup>)</b>, <b>Sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>)</b>,
 <b>Chloride (Cl<sup>-</sup>)</b>, and <b>Sulphate (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>)</b>. The ratio of the
 latter two is very important, which we will come back to later. Traditionally 
 the local water source from a particular region was used as-is without any adjustments and the
 character of some beer styles originates partly also from the mineral content of the
  water from the particular region where the brewery invented the style. 

  For example the Pilsner, light water, no minerals
  
  Some would also include Potassium (K<sup>+</sup>), but it's only really needed 
  in a very low amount for the yeast. K+ it's very similar to Na<sup>+</sup> in taste
</p>

<b>Calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>)</b> is the principal component of hardness. 
needed by alpha amylase
improves clarification

<b>Magnesium (Mg<sup>2+</sup>)</b> has a minerally and even bitter taste in excess.
 Generally keep it low (0-30 ppm) since it contributes with no flavor that is 
 relevant or supportive to beer.

<b>Sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>)</b> contributes a salty taste in excess. A prime example 
of a beer style with a high amount of Na<sup>+</sup> is the Gose (200+ ppm). 
Potassium (K<sup>+</sup>) has a similar taste, but is generally only needed as a yeast
 nutrient in a very small amount which most sources of water already has.

<b>Chloride (Cl<sup>-</sup>)</b>

<b>Sulphate (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>)</b>



<h2>Adjusting the mineral composition using salts</h2>

<h2>Sulphate to Chloride ratio</h2>

Bicarbonate 2000 ppm+ when beer is carbonated

<h3>TLDR</h3>
<ul>
<li>5 ions are the most important for the water profile of beer. 
  Those are Calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>),
  Magnesium (Mg<sup>2+</sup>),
  Sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>),
  Chloride (Cl<sup>-</sup>),
  and Sulphate (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>).</li>
<li>When it comes to taste, only chloride and sulphate, and the ratio between 
  them is relevant</li>
<li>Almost always keep Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> low.
  The only exception is when you want a salty taste, then raise the Na<sup>+</sup> level</li>
<li>It's not possible to raise the concentration of a single ion alone without also 
  increasing the concentration of another, because they can only be added as salts (a pair of cation+anion)</li>
</ul>
